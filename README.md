A Python-based virtual plant you can care for in real time. 
The plant responds to your actions, grows older, and may wilt or die if neglected. 
This project simulates plant care through interactive commands such as watering, sunlight exposure, nutrient management, and day/night cycles.

Features
Real-time vitals that update automatically
Options to water the plant, give sunlight, add nutrients, or check vitals
Day/night cycle system
Plant age tracking
Plant can die if vitals reach dangerous levels
